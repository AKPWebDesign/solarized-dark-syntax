## Solarized Dark Syntax Atom Theme

So this provides a dark syntax using the ever popular [solarized] colors.

### Installation

Currently you need to clone the repository, this will change in the future.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.atom/themes
cd ~/.atom/themes
git clone git@github.com:atom/solarized-dark-syntax.git
```

Then just remove any syntax theme you currently have in Atom's preference pane
and add the Solarized Dark Syntax theme and it should become effective
immediately.
